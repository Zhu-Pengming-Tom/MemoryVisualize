Memory and Process Management Visualization Tool

Memory and Process Management

Overview
This repository contains a JavaFX application that serves as a visualization tool for operating system memory and process management. The program allows users to interactively explore different memory allocation algorithms and observe the dynamic changes in memory utilization.

Features
1. Memory Allocation Algorithm Demonstration
The tool provides a visual representation of various memory allocation algorithms, including First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit. Users can observe how the program allocates memory space based on their algorithm selection.

User Interface: Utilizes a graphical display to represent memory regions, with different colors or patterns indicating various states (allocated, free, etc.).

Simulating Different Processes: Simulates memory allocation for different processes, allowing users to witness the impact of different algorithms on overall memory utilization.

2. Process Lifecycle Demonstration
The application demonstrates the lifecycle of processes, covering process creation, deletion, and monitoring.

Creating New Processes: Users can create new processes by filling out a form or selecting parameters such as memory requirements and execution time.

Deleting Processes: The tool showcases how the deletion of processes affects memory space and reflects these changes graphically.

Process Monitoring: Provides a real-time display of the current running processes, along with their memory usage and execution status.

3. Graphical Visualization Area
The graphical display area is continuously updated to reflect real-time changes in memory allocation.

Dynamic Updates: Reflects the current state of memory, with a focus on highlighting different colors or patterns to distinguish between various memory block states.

Simulated Process Execution: During demonstrations, the tool simulates the execution and release of processes, enabling users to observe graphical changes in the memory display.

4. User Interaction Demonstrations
The tool illustrates how users can interact with the application through buttons, dropdown menus, or tabs.

Algorithm Selection: Users can choose different memory allocation algorithms through dropdown menus or similar UI elements.

Process Management: Demonstrates how to create, delete, and view processes using the provided interface components.

Usage
To run the application, follow the installation instructions in the provided documentation. Once launched, explore the different features and algorithms through the user-friendly interface.

Demonstration
Ensure a smooth user experience during demonstrations by providing commentary or explanations at key points. Make it clear how the program handles memory allocation and process management.

Feel free to customize the demonstration based on the specific design and functionality of your program.
